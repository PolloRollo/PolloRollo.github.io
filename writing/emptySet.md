C: "Hurry! You are going to miss it!"

A: "Miss what? Who are–"

C: "Quickly! You must see my collection–my museum."

A: "And what exactly is your museum?"

C: "Have you ever heard of the Louvre?"

A: "Of course, it's famous! The world's greatest art is housed there."

C: "Well, every work of art in my museum is more famous than those at the Louvre."

A: "Art more famous than Greek statues? - more famous than the Mona Lisa?"

C: "And I'm sure you've heard of the Met. Every item in my museum is just as historic.
In fact, every item in there is older than anything you can imagine."

Impossible. How have you never heard of this place?

You approach a small building - no, a shack.
This can't possibly be right.
But as you approach you begin to make out the words
on the thin plaque hanging to the side of the door:
*Cantor's Museum*.

Your curious guide flips the plaque to now read *All the items inside are apples*.

A: "You brought me here for apples! This isn't what you promised!"

C: "Oh I'm terribly sorry, just a moment."

The stranger flips the sign back again,
except it now reads *Each animal inside is a giraffe*.

Your guide is frustrated. Again and again the sign is turned over:
*Every Picasso Within is an Original*, *Collection of the World's Unicorns*, *Every Tweet from Abraham Lincoln*....

The empty set is a unique mathematical object which often confuses students who first learn about it.
Let's clarify a few common misconceptions.

- It's all about content
- Vacuously true (Well obviously it's true!, Nothing says it's false)
- 


When we talk about interesting properties of the empty set,
we are most commonly referring to its contents.
The empty set itself, like all other sets, is a container.
It's the elements within the set that everyone is concerned about.
Like the museum above, and like other museums,
you aren't there for the museum.
You are there for what the museum holds-
the pottery, paintings, and statues.
Those art pieces have certain *properties*,
typically an astronomical price value,
that tie them all together.

As illustrated above, the empty set is like a museum with no contents.
Because there are no contents,
any statement you make about the elements of the empty set is vacuously true.
These statements can be mundane,
*The items inside are all apples*,
or impossible, *Collection of the World's Unicorns*.
Each are true.

Perhaps another explanation.
As a kid I had a coin collection;
coins of different values and from different eras.
If I removed one coin,
I would still have a coin collection.
If I were to repeat this action,
continually removing coins,
I could still call my collection a coin collection.
If every element within a set has the same properties,
removing one will not invalidate the statement about the collection.
Even when I remove the last coin,
my collection -- an empty set - is still a coin collection.
This thought process could be repeated with any collection of items
-- and each statement would still be true.
